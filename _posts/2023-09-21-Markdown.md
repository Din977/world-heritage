## Markdown 
Markdown is a coding language that is specially designed for bloggers and researchers. This code language is much easier compared to other coding languages (E.g. HTML, java) while learning this language, we can easily catch up with basic editors. Here we donâ€™t have to focus on open command and closing commands, everything is set up and structured. I believe learning codes with Markdown will make coding language interesting and simple.
