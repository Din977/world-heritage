This project is a trial project as a fulfillment of the digital methods in Religious studies course requirement. In order to complete and acquire credit, Students must submit a project using a digital software application and demonstrate with selective topics that exhibit their learning in their project.

## About project experience
When I have to briefly summarize this project, I have some mixed experiences. While using this collection builder for the first time, I was very excited and curious about it. But working with little negligence and simple mistakes will affect the whole project.

**Letter negligence**
Because of the uppercase letter mistake, my whole information was missing
After consulting with Dr.Frederik Elwert, when It was correct, I felt little relief. 

**Displaying picture**
When you are working on a project, and it does not seem to work after several attempts then obviously frustrated and that happened to me. Whenever you upload files, and they do not appear on the websites, then it is really annoying. 
After several attempts, I realized it was because of the image size, which must be less than 1 MB and pixel size 1280x640. After applying it when it was successful it brings the feeling That you have completed half of the project.
So, while working on this project, I learned some new learning and gained experience in developing websites. This project helps the new learner to visualize their data on a website with a beautiful interface.
